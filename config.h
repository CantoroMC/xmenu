/*
 * KEYBINDINGS
 *
 * Look at your /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h  (or the equivalent file
 * in your system) for a list of key symbol constants, and change the
 * macros below accordingly.  All key symbol constants begin with the
 * prefix XK_.
 *
 * For example, to use vim-like key bindings, set KEYSYMLEFT to XK_h,
 * KEYSYMDOWN to XK_j, KEYSYMUP to XK_k, etc.
 *
 * Note that the regular keys like ArrowUp, ArrowDown, Tab, Home, etc
 * will ALWAYS work, so you do not need to set them.
 *
 * If you do not want to set a key binding, keep it with the value of
 * XK_VoidSymbol
